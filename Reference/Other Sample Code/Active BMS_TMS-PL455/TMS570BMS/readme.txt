When the "TMS570SPI" definition in emb1428.h is enabled, the TMS570 SPI is used to communicate with EMB1428. The SPI chip select signals on EM1402 are generated by TMS570 SPI and GIO signals.

When the "TMS570SPI" definition in emb1428.h is disabled, the TMS570 software emulate an SPI interface using BQ76PL455A GPIO signals.
